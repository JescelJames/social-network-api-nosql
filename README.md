# Social-Network-API-NoSQL

## My Challenge: Build the an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list

## Description
This challenge helps view and make changes to the current database of a Social Network API utilizing Mongooose.


### This is a back-end of a Social Network API NoSQL challenge

- My motivation:  To gain a solid understanding of the relationships between MongoDB, Mongoose, and Express
- Why I took this challege: To understand the basic of back-end application with database utilizing Express, MongoDB, and Mongoose.
- What the challenge solved:  The back-end of the Social Network site can query and manipulate database.

### What I learned:  

1. Queries such as find, findOne, findOneAndUpdate, create, findOneAndDelete, deleteMany, findByIdAndUpdate.
2. Folder relationships between routes, models, controllers  
3. Models and Schema Types
4. Virtuals, Schema.Types.ObjectId, referencing to a schema
5. Self assigned in schema
6. Integrating schema types to a model.
7. Doing module.exports of async..await of queries and requiring them in router file makes it cleaner and easy to understand once you get used to it.
8. The longer I stare at codes, the more it make it easier to understand and grasp the concept.
